Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
In class Cafe:
_ I decided to overload restock() method since I don't need to restock everything all the time. Sometimes, in my understanding, you only need to restock just the coffee ounces and cream since they run out quicker than cups and sugar packets.
In class House:
_I overloaded the constructor since sometimes it is a crucial part of the construction process to know the maximum number of people who would reside in the building. Additionally, I give the constructor the functionality of only needing the name, address, and number of floors at construction time. 
In class library: 
_ I overloaded the constructor, similar to the house constructor, because some libraries do not have an elevator. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
